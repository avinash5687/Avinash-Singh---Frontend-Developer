1. **You**: WRITE ME A CODE TO CENTER A DIV
2. **ChatGPT**: Sure, here's a code snippet to center a div horizontally and vertically:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<style>
		.center {
			position: absolute;
			top: 50%;
			left: 50%;
			transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="center">
		<p>This div is centered.</p>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code, we first define a div with a class of `.center`. Then, we use CSS to position it in the center of the page. We set its position to absolute, which allows us to use the `top`, `left`, and `transform` properties to center it. The `top: 50%` and `left: 50%` properties move the top-left corner of the div to the center of the page. Finally, the `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` property moves the div back up and to the left by half its width and height, respectively, to center it perfectly.
3. **You**: SQL QUERY TO FIND 11TH HIGHEST RECORD
4. **ChatGPT**: Assuming you have a table with a column named "value" that you want to find the 11th highest record for, you can use the following SQL query:

```
SELECT value FROM your_table ORDER BY value DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10;
```

This query orders the values in descending order, skips the first 10 records using the OFFSET clause, and then returns the 11th record using the LIMIT clause.
